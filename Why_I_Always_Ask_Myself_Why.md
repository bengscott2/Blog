# A Series About My Learning:
## Why I Always Ask Myself "Why?"

So why am I here talking about ‘why’? As I’ve gone through this journey here at Makers you hear this word come up over and over again.  It’s a part of the ecosystem here. When someone next to us does something that looks interesting we ask ‘why did you do that like that?’.  When our code is misbehaving, for what feels like an eternity, you whisper in despair to your computer ‘why aren’t you working?’. Why comes up a lot but I want to talk about a specific why today. I want to talk about the why you should ask yourself before you even begin to write code, ‘Why am I about to do what I’m about to do?’

I could argue that you should be asking yourself why before everything you do in life but at the very least there’s one place I would highly recommend trying this out. That’s whenever you’re trying to learn something new. This very simple technique is important because it’ll accelerate your learning by making better use of your time.

Part of what they teach us at Makers is this idea of having goals. A big part of setting goals is that it forces us to ask why.  When I come upon new tech that I’ll be using I try to set out some goals that I think will be beneficial in trying to understand it. This means I need to set goals that give me an idea of what I need to know to understand this tech enough to use it in my project. So the first why I ask is ‘why do I need this?’. This gives me an idea of the minimum amount of information I’ll need to successfully integrate it into my project. Now I’ve gone from an abstract concept to a defined set of goals. On top of that I’ve also prioritised those goals by asking myself why. If I only need need some small aspect of a new tool I want to start learning about it where it relates to my project. Not aimlessly wander through documentation.

It’s very easy to get distracted with so much information out there but sometimes it’s fun to just explore! Also you can learn so much by playing with some new tech without a specific project in mind. The idea of asking why isn’t to discourage exploration.  There’s a time for exploration and that time may not be when you have a deadline looming and should be looking up how to connect your database to your application. If you have some free time and think that exploring a topic, albeit aimlessly, might be fun or interesting then you should do just that. The point here is that you are aware of what you’re doing.

I would argue this is the most important why you can ask. This why gives meaning to the work you’re about to embark on. This why can turn wandering through endless documentation and Stack Overflow posts into a deliberate march through this seemingly infinite amount of information.

So next time you’re at your computer, before you start typing, take 5 minutes to ask yourself why.

But most importantly be kind to yourself and try not to take life too seriously.
